    <p>   The moon slipped away in the night, surprising uncarefull travellers.</p>
    <p>And uncarefull, that was the second name of a kid, called Luke in first place.</p> 
    <p>He was heading to his uncle Arnaud'shelter when the darkness falled down on him.</p>
    <p>He got lost, followed unkown path leading into the wood...,4-27 wood.</p><br> 
    <p>As he got mostly in the heart of the wood, he heard strange noise and saw some lights</p>
    <p>He got closer, hoping to find some help.</p><br>
    <p>Then he figured out the weather was locally disturbed,
      the scene was suddenly blurred, awkward.</p>
    <p>Frightened, got goose bumps but holding on his courage, he tried to get closer.</p>
    <p>Hearing some uttered mystical incantation (css, html, vs, git push, merge,...), 
      he understood it was a druidic secret ceremony.</p>
    <p>No one would believe him, no living soul have never came back to told about rituals.</p>
    <p>   Crack, suddenly he had stepped on a dead branch.</p>
    <p>Oh no! what a fool, he run now away for his life, owls, wolves, weasels,
    ... on his footprints</p><br><br>
    <p>to be continued ...</p>
